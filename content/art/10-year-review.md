title: Ten Year Review

I recently was made aware of a fun little art trend recently that caught my attention. The premise was simply just a showcase of pieces an artist has made over the past 10 years starting from the beginning of 2015 to the end of 2024. This was my take on the trend.

As I went through my back catalogue I quickly came to the realization that summarizing an entire year with one piece was not only challenging but also left out very key bits of my art journey unaccounted for so I decided that it would be more appropriate to write this article portraying my thoughts on each year and where I was at.

## 2015 - A burgeoning passion

2015 was right in the middle of my exploratory phase of art. Digital art was still pretty new to me in the grand scheme of things and I hadn't quite been exposed to concepts like "studies" and whatnot so I really was just free-balling my artwork. I had not been exposed to the art world very much and my scope of what good art was out there was quite slim. I was mostly motivated by having fun as well as "being better" at drawing than my peers. I was still under a different alias and I wouldn't yet pick up the moniker "d-floe" until the following year.

During these early years there was a wide range of different styles and approaches and this trend continued for a few more years. There are small bits and pieces of my style had show there roots in this era, but I feel that my style had not really set in until much, much later.

I feel a weird mixture of pride and embarrassment when it comes to these early pieces. I think most artists feel some level of embarrassment when it comes to sharing old artwork. It's like sharing old photos of yourself to other people. That's not you anymore, but it was you, and the fact that there is a difference shows some form of growth. I am glad I explored as much as I did during this era. Even though I was doing the equivalent of smacking my head against a well to get through it, the process helped point me in a direction that best suited myself as a parson and formed the basis that would carry me on through my art journey. Of course, I didn't know any of this at the time, I was just a 16 year old doing art for fun.
