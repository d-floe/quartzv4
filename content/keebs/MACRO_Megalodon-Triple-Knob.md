## Megalodon Triple Knob Macropad

- Received: June 3rd, 2023
- Weight (built):  355g / 0.783lbs
### Summary

I got this macro pad after witnessing fellow illustrator [nemi](https://twitter.com/nemmmiii) work extremely quickly during a Discord screen share. He was able to speed through his linework process very quickly because he was able to rotate his canvas effortlessly using a rotary encoder. After doing some research on available options I landed on the Megalodon Triple Knob Macropad. It had a good balance of footprint and usability, but what I wanted most out of the macro pad was an easily programmable large rotary encoder. A lot of macro pads had much smaller rotary encoders which didn't allow for very comfortable and precise rotation. This was pretty much what I needed.

After using the macropad I noticed a few shortcomings:

- The stock large rotary encoder knob was hard to grip and lacked any concavity for my finger to rest and grip for easy rotation.
- The stock smaller knobs were was too large to get my fingers to comfortably grip between them. There just was not a large enough gap. to work with.
- The flip canvas button was hard to find and I really wanted a 2u vertical key to signify where it was so I could effortlessly identify it without needing to look over at my macro pad.
- I would really prefer some custom legends on this macro pad!
